# About

# What is Solid?

Solid is a specification that lets people store their data securely in decentralized data stores called Pods. Learn more about Solid on [solidproject.org](https://solidproject.org/).

# Test setting
If you run the tests on terminal using VS Code as the editor, you need to add this line `"terminal.integrated.env.osx": {"PYTHONPATH": "${workspaceFolder}"}` to `/.vscode/setting.json` to make it work.

# Credit
This project is inspired by (and porting from) [jeff-zucker/solid-file-client](https://github.com/jeff-zucker/solid-file-client)
I want to thank the original authors and the community who worked to build that lovely project for Solid ecosystem.
